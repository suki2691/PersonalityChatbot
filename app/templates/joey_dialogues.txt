chandler! hes here!

oh my god.
i suddenly had the feeling that i was falling. but im not.

with this ring?  no contest.
yeah. hes gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, shes gonna keep pretending she doesnt know even though she does, and my little sister tina cant see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that i found out today.

it was amazing! and not just for her... uh-uh. for me, too. its like, all of a sudden, im blind. but all my other senses are heightened, yknow? its like... i was able to appreciate it on another level.
i know! neither did i!
seven hundred bucks!

look, rach, rach! ive been with my share of women. in fact, ive been with like a lot of peoples share of women. the point is, ive never felt about anyone the way ross felt about you.
frankie? whatre you talking about?
no way. ive been going to the guy for 12 years.
thats how they do pants! first they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear.  what? ross, ross, would you tell him? isnt that how they measure pants?
what? thats not?  oh my god.
hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
i swear to god, dad. thats not how they measure pants.
i gotta get one, too.
yeah, we know, but theres a baby suckin on it.
uh, does it hurt?
chandler?

what is the big deal?
yeah, its kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...

or maybe its because this guys doing so good they wanna put more people on it.  you should see this guy, chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
i know, but, i was the best, you know? i liked being the best.  i dont know. maybe i should just get outta the game. they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.

charity.
oh, now youre tellin us how you feel.

hey, julie, i didnt know you wore lenses.
hey, heres a thought, ross.
ross, listen. i got two words for you. threesome.
ok, lets start with the cons, cause theyre more fun. all right, rachel first.
you could say that.
oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
hey, so howd it go with julie? did you, did you break her heart?
he broke up with julie. well, go hug her, for gods sakes.
hey, uh, why dont you read it to her?
hey, cut him some slack. it was chandlers idea.
hey, ross! what are you doin?
oh, yeah, i do.
i never know how long youre supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know?  maybe a little longer.
phoebe here with the cab yet?    chandler
theyre ribbed for your pleasure.
im excited! ive never gotten reviewed before.
here it is, here it is.   the only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was joseph tribbianis disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.
maybe they do. ive been doin this ten years and i havent gotten anywhere. theres gotta be a reason.
no, no, no, it.. its too hard. its not worth it. i quit.
when i was little, i wanted to be a veteranarian, but then i found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
no, im alright man. really.
hey no, seriously, i dont need you to pick me...  alright! it still works.
i just had a glass.
ooooooh.
monica, have you ever been with him when he  wasnt  drinking?
hey.
yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for  days of our lives !
with a man?
what about ross? i mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
well, i think it went pretty well. i.. i got a callback for thursday.
no.
ok, uh.... listen, theres something i want to talk to you about. the network casting lady...
oh yeah, yeah, shes great, but... i kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. and i definitely would get the part if i wouldve... you know... if i would have sent the little general in.
hey.
well, the parts mine if i want it.
yeah, if im willing to sleep with the casting lady.
ten years ive been waiting for a break like this chandler, ten years! i mean,  days of our lives . thats actually on television.
well, i guess i could sleep with her... i mean, how could i do that?
ive never slept with someone for a part.
sorry.
yeah, shes totally good looking. i mean, if i met her in a bar, or something, id be buying her breakfast.  you know, after having slept with her.
i just... i just dont think that i want it that way though, yknow? i mean, lets say i do make it, alright? im always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. yknow, the little general.
yeah, but after denise demarco, i had to promote it.
hey.
it was unbelievable! i walked in there and she was all over me.
well, i couldnt do it. i told her i didnt want to get the part that way.
but wait, wait, wait. then, after i left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
soooooo... you are now looking at dr. drake ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
alright... ive got to go shower.
it really hit me last night. im gonna be on days of our lives. and then i started thinkin about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
are you really not going?
hey, if she were marrying a guy, shed be like the worst lesbian ever.
no, im on right after this guy shoots himself.
yeah, and shes really nice too. she taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
its like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. so while youre thinkin of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
theres my scene, theres my scene.    mrs. wallace, im dr. drake ramoray, your sisters neurosurgeon.
im afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
all right, all right. damnit braverman, its right there on the chart!
i cant believe youre so uptight about your mom comin.
uh, pheebs, how long do you think this ladyll be with us?
pheebs, whos evelyn dermer?
they didnt fight a lot?
hey, look whos up.
im sorry, its the pigs. theyre reluctant to get in the blankets!

oh, hey. come on man, dont look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
look, what do you want me to say?
i cant. its like this chemical thing, you know. every time she starts laughing, i just wanna  pull my arm off just so that i can have something to throw at her.
yeah, then-then whos the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
i, ah, i never said hate, i was very careful about that.
and you got a hate from that?! your taking a big leap there...
but what does that gonna do...

hey!
yeah, yeah. we went to a mets game, we got chinese food, and you know, i love this woman. you have got competition buddy.
im sorry man, i tired, i really did.
but, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and i survived, and whats even more amazing, so did she. it was bat day at shea stadium.
no man, thats huge! now, i know i can stand to be around her, which means i get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
oh, hey, chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into ross.
hey, if it makes you feel any better, i do it too.
oh yeah, i always picture your mom when im having sex.
all right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.

monica, how are you gonna do that?
wow, what a cool job.  you have two new messages. please, pass the pie.
hey, you cant say youre breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
now she sounded breezy.

nooo. i had a story all worked out but then chandler sold me out.
what is this? fruit?
whoa, jam! i love jam!  hey, how come we never have jam at our place?

well, right after i did that sex study down at nyu.  hey, remember that sweater i gave you for your birthday?
noooo, thats what i was wearing when i donated. im kinda surprised theres any of my boys left.
maybe, i should call this place and get them to put my days of our lives on here. you know, juice this puppy up a little.
orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
hey.
where you going?
sperm or regular?
so youre really doing this, huh?
sounds nice.
no kiddin, hmm.
no, i-i figured you wouldve picked a blond guy.
i dont know, i just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... hoyt.
its a name, yeah. i saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
hes got the body for it.
you guys have one of those signs that says
sure you do, it was a gift from me. oh! and you have these three great kids.
yeah!
sure!  but hey, you know this way sounds good too.
oh monica.  wow, this guys an astronaut. that wouldve been cool,  for like a day. .
i called the sperm bank today, they havent sold a single unit of tribianni. nobody wants my product. i mean, i-i-i dont get it  maybe if they met me in person.

you guys, can we please not watch this all right.
oh, you said it mike.  aw! theres got to be a better way!

wow, it is easy.  now, i can have milk everyday.
hey!
maybe you can tell me. my agent would like to know why i didnt show up at the audition i didnt know i had today. the first good thing she gets me in weeks. how could you not give me the message?!
how is it you?
yep, thats my audition.
well, estelle tried, you know. the casting director told her that i missed my chance.
pheebs, you cant do that. the casting director doesnt talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
what, what are you doing? what are you doing?
hang up, hang up.
i love that movie.
im sorry, it just felt nice.
hey, i only got one good arm, you know. you should be doing stuff for me. go get me a sweater.
hey, you know about that?!
well, ive never been through the tunnel myself, cause as i understand it, youre not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. but, it seems to me its pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. it have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! if youre afraid of bugs.....get a bug. right. in this case, you have a fear of commitment, so i say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
oh, yeah. go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
come on baby, come on!
thank you so much.
you were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see theres this one other audition that i really, really want, and estelle couldnt get me in.
come on, please, itll be just this one more, well actually its two.

look listen, that tv movie i went in for? did you hear anything? i think i got a shot at it.
its okay, these things happen.
im, im okay. see.
no! no, no you cant quit! youre the best agent i ever had! look pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you cant take it personally.
they actually said that?
no, no, no, see thats why you have to do this job, agents always lie. you know, estelle just says stuff like they went another way, but this, i can use this.  i canna work on a new accent.
okay, shoot.
i didnt get it?
okay, what else?
oh.
look, its okay, no, no, no, really, look um, i really appreciate this pheebs, but i think im gonna have to go back to estelle.
yeah, well dont get me wrong, youre a better agent than she is, but at least with her i dont want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.

wait a minute.
wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
thats-ah what i suspected-ah.

i know!
good evening. im mr. tribbiani. and i will be teaching acting for soap operas. now um, on my first day as  dr. drake remoray on  days of our lives ,  i learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you dont have a line, but someone else just did. and it goes like this.  thanks, thanks, a lot. oh, by the way, before i forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. all right, moving right along.
hi!
oh it was great. yeah, you get to say stuff like, hey, the bell doesnt dismiss you,  i  dismiss you.
oh, and guess what, i got an audition for  all my children .
yeah, its this great part, this boxer named nick. and im so, so right for it, yknow, hes just like me. except hes a boxer, and has an evil twin.
hey, monica bought a bed from the mattress king?

hey, youre ah, pretty good at this.
ahh!
hey now!
hey!!! oww!! and im bleeding.
okay, great.
okay.
all right. i cant see.
okay, some tricks of the trade. now, ive never been able to cry as an actor, so if im in a scene where i have to cry, i cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. or ah, or, lets say i wanna convey that ive just done something evil. that would be the basic i have a fishhook in my eyebrow and i like it  okay, lets say ive just gotten bad news, well all i do there is try and divide 232 by 13.  and thats how its done. great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
hey-hey.

you bet! whats the part?
wow! that was good. that was... tweezers?
whoa. that was really good.
well, i-i mightve said supergay.
because, monica, the guys so good, and i really, really want this part.
there will come a time in each of your careers when youll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. i had such an opportunity in the recent, present. and im ashamed to say that i took it, i advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. and now, hes got a two year contract opposite susan luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me im stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on tv. im sorry, im sorry, im sorry.  thank you.
all right, jester man, look we wanna see the king.
oh-ho-kay, im talking to the king.

well, safer. yknow, i mean i never start reading  the shining , without making sure weve got plenty of room in the freezer, yknow.
havent you ever read the same book over and over again?
the question should be rach, what is  not  so great about  the shining . okay? and the answer would be
all right, you got it.
okay.
ah, now rach, these ah, these little women.
how little are they? i mean, are they like scary little?
these little women. wow!
oh yeah! amy just burned jos manuscript. i dont see how he could ever forgive her.
but jos got a crush on laurie.  oh. you mean its like a girl-girl thing? cause that is the one thing missing from  the shining .
no wonder rachel had to read this so many times.
what are you doing?  get back over on your side of the...  hello!!  hi, im joey, we havent met.
hey robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
hey!  hows it going?
hey, rach, how you doing with  the shining ?
oooh, the next parts the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
all right ill talk in code.  remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
oh, all blank, and no blank, makes blank a blank blank. oh no-no-no, no, the end when jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. aww!
hey! mine was by accident! all right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
beth, beth dies?
is that true? if i keep reading is beth gonna die?
then why would you say that?!
beth is really, really sick.
jos there, but i dont think theres anything she could do.
yeah.
okay.
wow! this girl is good.
so ah, phoebe tells us you write jingles.
ah, anything we might of heard of?
wow, that was kinda brutal.
ah, he cant make it, he said he had to his...  whoa-oh!
phew, close one.
hey.
is ah, is chandler around?
oooh.
nooo. no, no, ah, are you sure it wasnt something that sounded like ginger, like ah, gingeer?
aww, man. thats the girl i was hiding from. when she finds out hes my roommate, shes gonna tell him what i did.
what, oh, oh, oh, no, no, i cant, i cant tell you that, its like the most awful, horrible thing ive ever done my whole life.
all right!! okay, it was like four years ago. okay, ginger and i had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her dads cabin. just me, her, and her annoying little dog pepper. well that night, i cooked this really romantic dinner....
i wish. no. after dinner, me, her, and pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. well i woke up in the middle of the night and i saw that the fire was dying out. so, i picked up a log and threw it on. or, at least what i thought was a log.
i wish. see, i guess another thing i probably shouldve told you about ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
i ran!!
morning.
heard about the leg burnin huh?
listen, i ah, i know its a longshot. but, by any chance did she find that funny?
yeah. you okay?
yeah.
where have you been?
hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
done.
so pheebs whats this guy like?
yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
yeah!
uh, yknow what, were having second thoughts about our copying needs. and well need a little more time to think about it.
both of us?
well be there.
uh, 10
4
yeah. hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
she was kidding about that right?
god, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
dude, i dont know.
yeah.
yeah, for sure. okay. probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. yknow, because you dont want to be doing something and then look up and see something you dont want to be seeing.
ah!! okay! eyes open at all times! oh, hey, how do we decide where we...  yknow each would,  yknow  be?
yeah, i guess, but whats like heads and whats tails?
so what are you gonna do?
yeah, tell that to my uncle lenny.
nothing, hes just really believes in that.
yeah. we figured when we couldnt find you, youd gone home to make up with rachel. which is probably what you shoulda done. huh?
look, ross look, im on board about this totally honesty thing, i am, just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble.
yeah, and there wont be a relationship left to rebuild.
all right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesnt find out some other way.  did you think about the trail?
the trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!  you always have to think about the trail!
yeah, i-i think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, thats all. i mean, come on, its just a little wax.
okay, fine, so now what, i just pull it off?
dont answer that.
awful! horrible!
she was nothing compared to you.
ewwwww!
yknow what, i dont think we should listen to this anymore.
why not?!  im hungry.
yeah, well be fine.
oh man, pizza? i like pizza.  put olives on the pizza.
you think i need a new walk?
well yknow, ive been walking the same way since high school. yknow, yknow how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. i think i need a take notice walk.
whoa-ho-ho!  yeah, okay.
maybe she killed him?
no, i really have to pee.

okay,  may  i see the comics?
yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
well ross was hangin out over at our place, rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from chandler....
anyway! her and ross just started yelling at each other.
well, i guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
i had the same dream!
oh, i had the opposite dream.
yeah, i mean its never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
rach, its, its ah, its not that we dont want to, really.  are we talking models in their underwear?
ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
oh yeah.
youre smoking again?!

hey!

i think i left a donut up here.
hey!
that-that is a good trick.
chandler, look theyre actors. theyre there to do a job, just cause they work together, doesnt mean theyre gonna get together. i mean just cause it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins, it doesnt mean its gonna happen with them.
tom cruise and nicole kidman.
okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
well okay, so then youre fine. the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. okay? so as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.
look, you guys have been to every play ive ever been in, have i ever had chemistry on stage?
noooo!!
hey mon! want some pancakes?

ross! way to suck up to the family.
hey!

why dont you like pbs, pheebs?
im sorry pheebs, i just, yknow, i just wanted to do a good deed. like-like you did with the babies.
whoa! whoa! whoa! what about you, having those babies for your brother? talk about selfish!
well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
it made  you  feel good, so that makes it selfish. look, theres no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
well, may i ask for one example?
thats because all people are selfish.
are you calling you people?  yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, pheebs, but selfless good deeds dont exist. okay? and you the deal on santa clause right?
that he doesnt exist.
how ya doin? welcome. good to see ya!

well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? well, when ross said rachel at the wedding, i figured it was gonna happen again, so i hid this in here.

oh, come on! i wanna hear it! it wouldnt be thanksgiving without chandler bumming us out!
man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! i dont have any past life memories.

you guys  promised  youd be more careful! i mean, come on! the good joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
well, im telling everyone about you! thats the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesnt make me look like a pig!
yeah, i like that. but no-no, how does that explain why rachel found  my  underwear at your place?
well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
all right. hey, but it better make me look really, really good.  oh, and another thing, the video camera? nice!!

ahhoy! that was the underwear i was wearing that night in london. right monica?
no! if anyones a sex addict here, its monica! yeah. yeah. she has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since london!

but sadly i could not be enticed.
well, i think weve all learned something about whos disgusting and whos not. eh? all right, now, im going to get back to my bucket. im only eating the skin, so the chickens up for grabs.
what are you doing?
why are you doing this?
dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. youve got to spread it out a little, you know. havent you ever been unemployed?

shes a woman!
okay, is there anything else?
that part was perfect for me! i cant believe i didnt get it!
come on ross be realistic, yknow? if i did write something, what are the chances i could get those guys to star in it?
wait a second, i could star in it!
i cant write! yknow i mean i-i-im an actor, i dont have the discipline that takes, yknow? i cant do it.
really? youd-youd do that for me?!
thanks!

its not.
oh.
hey, how do you spell suspicious?
because i think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
youre driving me crazy with that!
dont stop! move the bowl further away! ross could make that shot!
well, you suck! but at least you suck at a mans game now.
chandler, i cant be playing games, ross is gonna be home soon. and i have to write five whole pages if im gonna stick to his schedule.
all right! but uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
all right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.

uh yeah, right here.
yeah, thats the uh, game we were playing.
youre right, youre right, ill get back to work.

yknow, breadstick fangs are always funny.
uhh, look katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. okay? umm, look i like you. i-i really do, i like you a lot. okay? but sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someones hitting me with a very tiny but very  real  bat.
no-no.
yeah, big!
uh-oh, shht! the misses.
hey!
thanks! ive been working out. hey listen, is it obvious that im wearing six sweaters?
well look, im breaking up with katie so i had to put on some extra padding. yknow? i mean, if she hits me when shes happy, can you imagine how hard shes gonna hit me when i tell her im taking away the joey love?
hey! hiya!
huh.
uhh.
nah.
what a bad idea!
shes right yknow.
hey ross, will you pass me that knife?

dont worry, there wasnt any sex in it or anything. i havent dreamt about her like that since i found out about you two--ish.
well, okay. you were my girlfriend and  we  were doing the crossword puzzle. yknow like you guys were doing last night. so, thats it. im in love with monica and ill be moving out.
it-it doesnt?
that kinda sounds like your dream dude.
in the dream i did enjoy the closeness.
not really.
no, i dont think its just about just getting a girlfriend. yknow? i mean, yeah, i can get a girlfriend! yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but yknow are we ever going to have yknow the closeness like-like you guys have?
friends first? thats interesting.
no, never done that either.
how you doin?
oh, id love too, but i got acting class. but yknow what? i guess i can blow that off,  for you.
uh, hey, rach let me ask you something. uh, i was just over there talking to monica and chandler, boy they are really tight.
yeah thats not such a bad situation they got going over there. im thinking of getting me one of those.
well, the reason i think monica and chandler are so great
is because they were friends first. yknow? so i asked myself, who are my friends? you and phoebe, and i saw you first. so
im saying maybe you and i crank it up a notch.
ill treat you real nice.
wont-wont that take longer?
yeah. i understand. i understand.   man , i wish i saw phoebe first!
hey!
yeah, yeah, i met this woman.
uhh, well, shesreally good in bed.
well look, hey, its all your fault!
well because you didnt give me advice! no! you gave me a pickup line! as soon as i told her i wanted to yknow, build a foundation and be friends first. i suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!  and her roommate!
closeness-shmoshness! there was three of us for crying out loud!
all right! hey, who wants pizza?!
oh, great! can you believe i found it on the second floor?

oh yeah, yeah! hes done tons of commercials. ive seen him in like sugar smacks,  playstation , and that one for the phone company. in fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. chandler was mad.
thats great. listen, wouldnt it be great though if i got to play bens dad?
i look more like him than you do!
yeah, i had to teach ross my bit because i actually didnt get a callback.
yeah i did!
well, unfortunately, i dont get many callbacks so

hey pheebs!  hey!
ross good, im uh glad youre here. i wanna talk to you about something.
well, ive been thinking about this whole commercial thing, yknow me going up against ben, the two of us competing, and that cant lead to anything good. so, i think im just gonna step aside. im gonna tell them that i wont audition.
thats it? youre-youre gonna let me do this?! this-this is my career were talking about here!
i just said that so you wouldnt let ben do it! look ross, if anyone should step aside it should be ben!

everything on your application looks really goodohh! just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
whoa!! now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. i want you to really think about your answers. okay?
oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but i dont think hes gonna get it.
that thing was a hazard!  im very safety conscious.
umm, listen, ross do you really think this moving in with rachel is a good idea?
yeah well, maybe you should go back! okay? rachel moves in, and before you know it youre right where you dont want to be! back together!
thats not gonna work out! then shes gonna come home all weepy and youll be tellin her, oh thats okay. youll find someone. and then,  bamn ! she finds you!
i am telling you ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! now, is that what you want?
here she comes. hold on, im gonna make your life much easier.
or not. uh, rach, why dont you just move in with me?
no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no its okay, i mean ilook rach, i know i scared you off with that whole naked thursdays thing, but we dont have to do that!
thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
hi!

hey! any good mail?
ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, im kinda.

no way! kay look, if i have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
why did i have to start working out again?  damn you 15s!
dude! hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. besides its getting darker and more painful, that means its healing.
thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and i dont want that hanging over my head. okay? besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in i can get all the free operations i want! yeah, im thinking ill probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
hey!
look, im telling you if i put my hand on my stomach right here  it doesnt hurt that bad.

i dont know! i really want this part! and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell em you can! and just figure out how to do it later.
i kn-i know! i know! okay? and apparently tomorrow when i go in to meet the director i have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
i just have to call my agent and tell her i cant do the part.

but rachel has an apartment.
she is?
i guess i didnt really think about it.
hey!
oh, okay. ii ate way too much.
ooh.  so umm, i was talkin to ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
i was kinda hoping youd stay.
no room? its a baby. its like this big.  yknow, i mean you-you could you could put it over here.  or-or-or we could put it right here.  aw, its cute, right? or-or we could put it over here.  you wouldnt even notice it. wheres the baby?
i could use a challenge! its getting pretty easy.
i love living with you so much. i just wish things didnt have to change.
yknow i blame ross for this.
im gonna miss you, youre the hottest roommate i ever had.
hey! uh, this is just to give you an idea. okay well, we can put screens here,  so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. and uhoh look! heres a baby monitor , which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. huh?
ahhhhhhhhhhhh. that-that-thats really just to show where the baby would go. yknow why dont i hold on to him so that theres no confusion?
im loud!
im up all night!
hello!
look, if im bringing home a woman who cant stand being around a baby, then maybe i dont want to be with that woman! or maybe well just do it in the bathroom of the club!
yeah! all rightlook, i know sometimes itll be hard, okay? but, itll also be reallyreally great. please rachel! i-i-i really want you to stay.
ohh!
i know! i found it on the street.
yeah.
i dont know.
ew.
ooh! ah! okay!
isnt that great?
its a grand tradition!
this is so unfair! the one thing i wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, i wasnt allowed to. all i got was a stupid steak dinner!
oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
so uh, you and mona, been a while now. hows it going?

thats her! okay, come on!
uh, that-thats-thats me!
joey tribbiani, a big fan.
why-why would she go in the bedroom?
yeah, thats one naked hooker!
wait! wait! maybe shes a hooker  and  a stripper, but she got confused about what shes supposed to do.
maybe monicas playing a joke on ya. yknow? getting her own husband a hooker, thats pretty funny.
i bet ross was in on it too. i mean he was conveniently busy.
hey ross. its joey. theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it.
maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
maybe she wants you to learn something. huh? now is there anything youre really bad at yknow, sexually?
in a minute!
all right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
hey! its your bachelor party.
i dont want to. you do it!

i miss this.
no, i-i miss hanging out with you.
not like we used to. remember? you and me used to be inseparable. yknow now its likethings are different.

well, i was due.
hey.
well uh, i wanted to have a few beers, but uh, i got rid of those because rachel couldnt stand the smell of them. but i have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. and uh, its a couple weeks past its expiration date, so its got a bit of a kick.
are you kidding me? im great! yeah, im uh; im better than great. i am good. and now that shes gone, i can uh, i can do all this stuff around here that i couldnt do before. yknow? like umm, i can walk around naked again. yknow? i can uh, i can watch porn in the living room. right? this is uh, this is good for me. yknow? i like being on my own, im uh, better off this way. im uh, a lone wolf. yknow? a loner. alone. all alone. forever. whats a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!

thats not fair! i cant do that.
see this is what i was afraid of, i didnt think i should be here either but somebody  said hed be over it by now.
hey.  ross, i know youre pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
fine, fine okay.  but i gotta say technically, i didnt even do anything wrong.

look, can i just stop you right there for a second? when people do this  i dont really know what that means.  you were saying?
i know i shouldve.  im sorry.
no, come on ross!  look, ross, we have to get past this.

you should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.

no, hey, its been great.
yeah. and look, i just want you to know that with rachel staying       here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay?       and even if they werent, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using       a breast pump...

why are they doing this?
you know whats crazy? these jars. what is it, like two bites in       here?
i know, i know. and when they moved back in together, i figured yknow,       thats where things were headed.
yes, and they should name one of their kids joey. i may not have       kids; someones gotta carry on the family name.
yeah, because it is slim pickings. i had this date last night

i dont know, but one of the extras sure did!  hey, listen rach. thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
also so  gay !
well, at the christmas party him and santa did some definitely gay stuff!
oh, wish me luck!
rach, i gotta say...if you werent here wondering if these guys were gay i dont know if i could do this!
hey!
oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-stars good  but theyre not as good as me !
ow, im just going over the script now! you wanna read lines with me?
oh, all right, i can ask monica.
right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.

ah, rach, it doesnt say that!
but, but..
hey!
oh man! i thought i got it all!
i was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?
and i couldnt find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender...and i thought...well... how important can that be, right...? turns out very!
what?
oh...i dont think its going very well...
well, im feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...
a little. yeah no, i really am worried, you know, i mean i have to make it convincing that im in love with olivia.
so...ive never played that!
uh...well...just once...with you...
what the hell are you talking about??
oh! ok, yeah, i think i can do that. yeah ok, theres this party scene coming up.. and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he cant... and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didnt know so i would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.
well.. hey, you know what else i could use? theres a scene where drake sneaks into olivias bedroom, and she doesnt know hes there - which never happened with us! and he knows he shouldnt be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?  and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when i would think to myself, my god, she...is... beautiful...  and it hurts so much, cuz i knew i could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
thanks dude!!!this is great!!

yeah... i think we do... ... about what?
hey...
uh... charlie and i broke up.
oh well, she said we have nothing in common.

i mean, she should be with someone like... ross! you know what i mean, he uses all those big words too! man, smart people are dull!
ok, rach!
i feel so stupid, you know? why... why do i keep going after the wrong girls?
oh, cmon, i mean, theres you, then theres charlie, and its like...  what the hell is my problem? oh!

yeah, he had a paper route.
no, i know, yeah i know were great but rach no... this... this cant happen!
no, no! it cant happen at all!
because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok?  i have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once  did i ever  say no!  i couldnt do it to ross!
i know, i know! but ive thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldnt be right...  im sorry...!
no! no-no-no-no-no-no! hey! hey, well be fine! li... hey, like you said

oh my god, its ross. what are we gonna do?
no idea what it means.
i dont believe this... have you guys been...
is he gone?
pssst...
well, hes with charlie now.
youre a pain in   my ass, geller!
probably, yeah... i mean, maybe we should... hold off   until we talk to ross.
yeah, i think thatd be best... so, so im gonna...   im gonna take off...
i like although!
six years? wow... its almost as long as highschool...
absolutely! hes not thinking about  you .
im thinking about you...
lets forget about ross...
whats wrong?
well, maybe i can help.
yeah... we really need to talk to ross...
whoo, whoo. wow, its uhm... kinda weird that im sitting   next to charlie after we broke up.
look, does someone mind switching to sit with charlie?
i understand...
i guess so. im just... really nervous.
ooh...
im gonna get the lasagna.
hey!
yeah?
you kissed.
i saw you.
ross, ross, ross... its okay.
its  okay . you know, i totally understand,   alright? you guys, make way more sense than her and i ever did, you know. and...   i want you to be happy.
yeah... now i have something...
oh... uh...  look... before you...
i am those things, yeah.
dude!
i cant think of anything.
yeah.
i couldnt. he was saying all these really nice things   about me. i didnt want him to get mad and take em all back. im on a edge   on chandler.
thank you. yeah, i appreciate that.
hey!
so, did you err... did you tell ross?
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... i think its better   if you tell him, you know. its easier for a woman. that way, you know, if   he gets mad, all you have to do is go...  i didnt mean it. im so so--ooory.
alright, alright, okay, uhm... how bout this, how   about this? tomorrow... tomorrow well both go and well tell him together.
i know, i know..., but thats okay. i mean, we can   control ourselves, were not animals.
yeah! good night!
good night!
stop saying good night.
okay, ross, i realise that you didnt expect to walk in and see  that, but.. let me explain, okay?
rach, he just saw us.
but what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? one kiss.

hey mr. and mrs. geller! let me help you with that.
oh man, this is great, uh? the three of us together again! you know what    would be fun? if we gave this present to emma from all of us!
hey pheebs, you know what? i was thinking... since you wrote a song,    maybe i could do something for emma using my talents!     phoebe
no, no, no! my talents as an actor!
you know, i could like maybe... i could do a dramatic reading of one    of her books!
hey, i think emma might like it!
um, my present!
actually we prepared performances.
but equally real!
o k.
hey, i do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole    crew waiting!
i will be doing a dramatic reading of one of emma’s books.
uh, why, it’s a...  one of her favorites, uh,     “riding the storm out. coping with post-partum    depression” eesh!  “love    you forever”. love you forever. by robert munsch. published by firefly    books. printed  in mexico.    a mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and    forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang “i’ll love    you forever, i’ll like you for always, as long as im living, my baby    you’ll be”. .    and while he rocked her, he sang “i’ll love you forever, i’ll    like you for always, as long as im living, my baby you’ll be”.
uh.. is it ok that i still think it looks delicious?
im so confused!

uhm... oh! okay. you come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
woah, uh! okay, lets hear your great idea.
ahh! theres gotta be a way. i mean, you know, if monica and chandler move out here and now phoebe is married to mike. that just leaves me and ross and rach, you know what i mean?
what am i gonna do, i feel like im losing my friends.
oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, youre young. me, im set in my ways.
yeah, yeah, i guess.
yeah, maybe.
i hate to admit it, but youre probably right. how did you get to be so smart?
just when i thought we could be friends.
hey!
oh, just er... you know, looking around. but you know what? this house... is great.
oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
what?
thats not funny! you know im afraid of little girl ghosts!
what? i get my own room?
oh my god!  oh! hey, can i have an aquarium? and a sex swing?
why not? ill keep the tank clean.
i mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am i missing opportunities? you know, ive always thought of myself as a serious actor. i mean, should i be trying to do more independent movies?
hey bear, i need some career advice.
hey, great! all right!
what? no, no, no! no, no... no... no, no... no, too much is changing,    okay? first, phoebe getting married  congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid    suburbs...
well, it comes and goes. i wouldnt trust it.
no, no, no. my hugs are reserved for people staying in america.
hey! no! get your france-going-arms away from me.
hey phoebe.
i’m just mad at my agent.
there’s a part in a tv movie that i would be perfect for and i    didn’t even be put up for it! she’d better have a good reason.
well  i’m wanna hear it,    because she keeps doing this.
ok. why?
i love that saying!
hello?
i was just gonna call you! that’s weird.
yeah, actually i am!
that’s it? you know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
no, no, look. all i’m saying is that you’re my agent, ok?    and you’re not getting me into any auditions and i’m tired of it.
i’m saying that… . this isnt  working for me    anymore, ok? estelle, you’re fired. goodbye. .
yeah, i just… i just feel bad about firing estelle. this is got to be    killing her.
i don’t know. she’s got to be taking it hard, i was like    her only client. except for this guy who eats paper. and i’m guessing    he eats more money than he makes. look, i know she’s not a great agent, but    she did stick with me for ten years. i’m gonna call her and hire her again.
why?
you blow me away.
i promise. and that means, never having to give a reason.
oh my god.  hello?
estelle?
ok-ay. i just, i cant believe youre calling me?
no, no, no!  dont drop by,    dont drop by!
can i ask you something? uhm, whats it like there?
thanks for everything estelle. bye.     out of area. boy, ill say.
thank you all for coming. were here today to pay respects    to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman...     ..inside. as estelles only two clients we would like to say a few words.  dude, wheres    my speech?  that  is     entertaining. al zebooker everybody.

oh, shes putting emma down, shell be over in a second.
now it just hit her that shes leaving and shes kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?

you know, i had a chance to stop her too!
who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? head she wins, tails i lose.  wait a minute...
i forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
huh, if i had to  guess id say rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and phoebe is doing the punching.
i really made you think about that thing uh?
lucky bastard!
all right, lets think about this. i mean, theres got to be an explanation. uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
im sure hes not more bummed out than i am.
oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.
whos that dirty old lady?

chandler, wait, wait, wait...

hey!
its my house-warming present for monica and chandler.
uh-huh. and i named them chick jr. and duck jr.
yeah, i figure theyll love it at the new house, you know? it    has that big backyard. and then, when they get old, they can go to    that special farm that chandler took the other chick and duck to.
yeah. its a shame people cant visit there.
yeah, erica went into labor last night. monica and chandler are    at the hospital right now!
uh, i think shes still asleep. hey, hey, how did it go with you    guys last night? she seemed pretty pissed at you.
oh my god. you and rachel?
so what does that mean? are you guys getting back together?
so, so is she still going to paris?
okay.
i bet you did!
sure, yeah. will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
oh my god! what did you say?
you cant just give up! is that what a dinosaur would do?

monica just called from the cab. she said they should be here   any minute. and apparently, theres some big surprise.

oh, theyre so cute! now, what, what kinds are they?
hey, that pregnant girls name was erica.
hey, maybe thats for the best.
yeah. you know? you just... look, you gotta... you gotta think    about last night the way she does, okay? maybe, maybe sleeping    together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
maybe thats okay. you know? maybe, maybe it is better this way?    i mean, now, now you can move on. i mean, youve been trying to for so   long, maybe now that youre on different continents..  right?
maybe now you can actually do it. you know? you can finally get   over her.
